            <p>Fact: Sliders are the perfect party food. What’s even better is when they take practically no time to make but look and taste mega gourmet.<br>Oh, hi, 15-minute buffalo chicken sliders. (No one needs to know it’s rotisserie chicken and store-bought buffalo sauce.)</p></li>

            <p>So you really, <em>really</em> don’t feel like cooking. (We’ve been there.) But if you have five ingredients, a few pantry staples and 20 minutes,<br>you can make chicken and snap pea stir fry. It’s easy, tasty and way healthier than that greasy takeout you were about to order.</p></li>

            <p></p>Hey, there’s nothing wrong with dumping jarred marinara onto your plate of pasta. It takes two minutes.<br>But sometimes we want something a little more…elegant. That’s where this 15-minute lemony broccolini pasta comes in.<br>It’s gorgeous enough to serve at your next dinner party, but not too fancy for the kiddos.</li>

            ><p>Your favorite Thai takeout joint makes it look so simple. On those nights when you’re craving pad Thai,<br>try this 15-minute cheater’s version instead. It’s quick and easy enough for weeknights,<br>but fancy enough for Saturday night with a glass of wine.</p></li>

            <img src="images/ravioli_lasagna.webp" alt="Image of ravioli lasagna">
            <p>Forget lasagna noodles. In this dish, we layer ravioli (meat, cheese, mushroom--whatever kind you're feeling)<br>for the most epic baked pasta dish ever. Trust us, this ravioli lasagna recipe will be your new dinner go-to.</p></li>
